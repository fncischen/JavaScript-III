/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* SUMMARY:  The value of "this" is
*  referencing the scope of function is executing the this keyword.
*
* 1. Implicit binding uses the dot notation (this.) to reference the nearest object scope / execution context of the function. 
* 2. Explicit binding allows for the clear, explicit defining of "this", since both call() and apply() methods allow direct
* reference the input arguments to the object you want to bind those arguments/properties to. You are clearly defining the execution context of a function.
* 3. When a constructor function is used, this refers to the object that the constructor function is creating. 
* 4. When a object method is used, this refers to the object that the method derives itself from. 
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
